Bati Bank is collaborating with an eCommerce company to offer a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service. The goal of this project is to develop a Credit Scoring Model that will assess the risk of potential customers and determine their eligibility for the BNPL service. The model needs to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan or credit line. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that categorizes customers as "high risk" (bad) or "low risk" (good), predicts their credit score, and suggests optimal loan amounts and durations.
